\description{
Data containing the abundance of 17 species  
   expressed in spectral counts. Data generated from an Orbitrap 
   Fusion Lumos  Tribrid Mass Spectrometer. The dataset contains 
   the metaproteomes from three extraction methods: i) "Q" for Qiagen, 
   ii) "FW" for fecal waters, and iii) "Q_FW" for the mixture 
   of Qiagen and fecal waters. Data generated in the context of 
   the project Microbiome Rapid Access (Universit√© Paris-Saclay).
