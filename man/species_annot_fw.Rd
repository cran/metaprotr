\description{
Data containing the abundance of 15 species 
   expressed in spectral counts and with functional annotation. 
   Data generated from an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid 
   Mass Spectrometer. The dataset contains the metaproteomes 
   from three extraction methods: i) "Q" for Qiagen, 
   ii) "FW" for fecal waters, and iii) "Q_FW" for the mixture 
   of Qiagen and fecal waters. Data generated in the context of 
   the project Microbiome Rapid Access (Universit√© Paris-Saclay).
